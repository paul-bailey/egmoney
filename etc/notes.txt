Path:
        $HOME/.egmoney/

Files in path:

        egjournal.bin
                list of ledger entries
        backups/egjournal_`date +%s`.bin
                backup of egjournal.bin.  Once one backup is made, older
                backups could be cleaned up.

Programs:

 egm-append
        Add a new entry from interactive command line to egjournal.bin
 egm-appendf
        Add a new entry from file to egjournal.bin
 egm-balance
        Print the balance of one or all accounts
 egm-cash-creep
        calculate cash-creep and append to egjournal.bin if necessary
 egm-report
        print various types of human-readable accounting reports (probably
        csv files).
 egm-sort 
        **TODO** just get rid of this.
        Replace egjournal.bin with list sorted by transaction date (NOT
        time stamp)
 egm-dump
        Read from egjournal.bin and translate into ASCII onto standard out
        **TODO** Change from report style to json style, have egm-report
        do the report style.
 egm-backup
        Back up egjournal.bin

File form of a journal entry:
"entry": [{
  "date": "8/16/16",
  "transaction": [{
     "account": "101",
     "amount": "-105.2"
  }, {
     "account": "502",
     "amount": "5.2"
  }, {
     "account": "505",
     "amount": "100"
  }],
  "notes": "Sundry odds and ends"
}]

Future program structure:

 egm-daemon
        1. Manage balances.bin as a memory struct, backing it up every
           hour or so
        2. Back up egjournal.bin every hour or so.
        3. Manage socket access to memory struct of balances.bin, so that
           programs do not need to access balances.bin directly.
        4. Maybe do 3. for egjournal.bin as well.
 egm-cli
        Interface with database via egm-daemon
 egm-qt
        GUI version of egm-cli

Pitfalls:
 How to update account balances?
  - Add an unchangeable time stamp of entry for every entry, and use that
    stamp with the account balances file.
  - Sort only checks according to date of transaction, not time stamp.
  - 1-second precision will do.

 How to back up?
  - Akin to "Easier with a daemon?"
